1DBipoly

//Kundan Kadam July 16 2014

Purpose:
1. Creates a 1d bipolytropic star with core and envelope having different polytropic indices.
   There can be a molecular weight jump at the interface.

Required:

   
How to use:
1. Specify relevant parameters in file 
2. Do:
   >> make clean
   >> make
   >> ./scf
   
Note:
Code is also known as corrected SCF code. The very first attempt at creating biplytropic binary
had some issues with convergence. Patrick Motl provided me with this version of SCF which used
different Poisson solver, and it works.
